# Memefy
Memefy works by sending the user's captured photo to the Emotion API from the cognitive services, which estimates its emotion values. The picture is then matched to a meme text with the closest emotional quality, selected from a database of meme texts which have pre-defined emotion values. The user can manage the database of memes, and can add, delete or update their details.
